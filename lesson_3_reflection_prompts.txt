When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	I would use a remote repository if I wanted to save my work online and share with collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might pull changes rather than letting git automatically stay up-to-date if you want to manage the merge when pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    The difference between branches and clones is a clone is a local copy where as a branch might have different commits and purpose altogether. A fork isn't like a branch because it is derived from another users repository that is moved to your account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

		The benefit of having a local copy of the last known state of the remote is you will know of any potential conflicts that may arise between them.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I might try to collaborate without github or git by using a separate text document where all contributors could write a log of their changes. This would be much harder and would likely lead to more conflicts and more errors in code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Branching out from master has the benefit of giving you the ability to try new things without affecting the master branch where others might be working. It also gives you the ability to share your changes to the master branch with others before merging it in.
